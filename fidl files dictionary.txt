# 4dfp
* fidl functional and anatomical storage format
* each 4dfp 'image' has 3 parts.
	1. <filename>.4dfp.img		# binary float voxel data
	2. <filename>.4dfp.ifh		# interfile header (ASCII text)
	3. <filename>.4dfp.hdr		# ANALYZE 7.5 header (binary)  

* There exists tools to take 4dfp to nii (4d), generating if setup the proper affine and other needed metadata. 

# fidl
* Defines/represents the timing of trial events and the names of experimental conditions.
* It generates the DM, though there does not appear to be a stable DM format.
ary)
* The format is:
	1. line 1 is the header, of the form below. TR is the TR, and cond1 and so on are string names for the experimental condtions.  Each of the string conds match integers, indexed from 1 to N, in the preceeding lines.  It is a silly system.

			TR cond1 cond2 cond3 ....
	
	2. line 2 (and rest) are is the time (in seconds) the event occured, index from (ask Josh)?, followed by the cond coded as an interger (see above) and then ? and optionally a parametric scalar.
			
			time cond_as_int ? ?

			
# glm_list
* A list of Ss level statical maps (i.e. glms in fidl parlance)


# .rec
* Is a (hierarchical) record of all transformations done to a given (data containing) fidl file.
* The time of atomic (?) operations, the code for the operations, and any log info is retained.  Additionally it seems that branch points of operations are also recorded using a running index in the leftmost column (need to confirm this though).


# .mat
* ?


# dat, ddat, rdat
* ?


# .lst
* Has something to do with cross S realignment of data; seems like an internal file format so I'll neglect to investigate any more.
