""" Reformats *_vox.txt files from fidl into a tabular format easily 
progamatically used.  New files are created for every condition, and some 
fidl specific metadata is lost. 

NOTE: If you have levels, or any character data in the timecourse data proper, 
it must be in lower case ONLY.  Uppercase characters outside of the fidl 
metadata/formatting will break the script.
